      <h1> C </h1>
      <h2>Introduction to C</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Introduction to C course! In this module, we'll explore the fundamentals of the C programming language, covering its history, basic syntax, and key features.</p>
      
      <h3>What is C?</h3>
      <i>
        C is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency, flexibility, and versatility. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C quickly became one of the most influential programming languages, serving as the foundation for many other languages and operating systems. Its simplicity, combined with low-level features, makes it suitable for system programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing. C provides direct access to memory through pointers, enabling precise control over hardware resources and facilitating efficient manipulation of data structures. Its syntax, influenced by B and Algol, emphasizes structured programming principles, allowing for the creation of clear and concise code. With a rich standard library and extensive community support, C remains a popular choice for developing operating systems, device drivers, compilers, and many other critical software systems. Its portability, efficiency, and close-to-the-metal capabilities make it an essential language for programmers seeking to understand the fundamentals of computer science and software development</i>
      
      <h3>History of C</h3>
      <p>C was developed to provide a structured and efficient alternative to assembly language. Its development was closely tied to the UNIX operating system, making it popular in the early days of computing.</p>
      
      <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
      <p>C programs consist of functions, which contain statements. Statements are instructions that perform specific tasks, such as variable declarations, assignments, and control flow.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Types</h3>
      <p>C supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and pointers. Understanding data types is essential for writing efficient and reliable C programs.</p>
      
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They provide modularity and reusability to C programs by encapsulating logic into manageable units.</p>
      
      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <p>C supports various control flow structures, such as if-else statements, loops, and switch-case statements, allowing programmers to control the flow of execution based on conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>Compilation and Execution</h3>
      <p>C programs are typically written in source code files with a .c extension. They are compiled into executable machine code using a C compiler before being executed.</p>
      
      <h3>IDEs and Tools</h3>
      <p>There are several integrated development environments (IDEs) and tools available for C programming, including GCC, Visual Studio, and CLion. These tools provide features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging.</p>
      
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>To get started with C programming, you'll need to install a C compiler and set up your development environment. You can begin by writing simple programs to understand the basics and gradually explore more advanced topics.</p>

    <h2>Let's practise one simple example </h2>
    <pre><code>#include stdio.h

        int main() {
            # Print "Hello World!" to the console
            printf("Hello World!\n");
            printf("C programming with CodeNub!\n");
        
        
            # Return 0 to indicate successful execution
            return 0;
        }</code></pre>
    <h2>Your C Code</h2>
    <div id="userCode" class="code-editor">
        <textarea id="codeTextarea" rows="21" style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" placeholder="Write your Java code here..."></textarea>

    <button id="runButton" onclick="runCode()">Run Code</button>
  </div>

 <br><hr>
 Keep pushing yourself to practice and experiment with coding.
    <br>
    Remember, coding is not just about learning concepts but also about experimenting and applying them creatively.
